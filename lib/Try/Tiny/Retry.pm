=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use just like L<Try::Tiny>, but with C<retry> instead of C<try>. By default,
C<retry> will try 10 times with exponential backoff:

    use Try::Tiny::Retry;

    retry     { ... }
    catch     { ... }
    finally   { ... };

You can retry only if the error matches some conditions:

    use Try::Tiny::Retry;

    retry     { ... }
    retry_if  { /^could not connect/ }
    catch     { ... };

You can customize the number of tries and delay timing:

    use Try::Tiny::Retry ':all';

    retry     { ... }
    delay_exp { 5, 1e6 } # 5 tries, 1 second exponential-backoff
    catch     { ... };

You can run some code before each retry:

    use Try::Tiny::Retry;

    retry     { ... }
    on_retry  { ... }
    catch     { ... };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module extends L<Try::Tiny> to allow for retrying a block of code several
times before failing.  Otherwise, it works seamlessly like L<Try::Tiny>.

By default, Try::Tiny::Retry exports C<retry> and C<retry_if>, plus C<try>,
C<catch> and C<finally> from L<Try::Tiny>.  You can optionally export C<delay>
or C<delay_exp>.  Or you can get everything with the C<:all> tag.

=func retry

    retry    { ... }  # code that might fail
    retry_if { ... }  # conditions to be met for a retry
    delay    { ... }  # control repeats and intervals between retries
    catch    { ... }; # handler if all retries fail

The C<retry> function works just like C<try> from L<Try::Tiny>, except that if
an exception is thrown, the block may be executed again, depending on the
C<retry_if> and C<delay> blocks.

By default, if no C<retry_if> blocks are provided, retries depend only on
the C<delay> block.

If no C<delay> block is provided, the default will be 10 tries with a random
delay up to 100 milliseconds with an exponential backoff.  (See L</delay_exp>.)
This has an expected cumulative delay of around 25 seconds if all retries fail.

=func retry_if

    retry    { ... }
    retry_if { /^could not connect/ }
    catch    { ... };

A C<retry_if> block controls whether a retry should be attempted.

The block is passed the cumulative number of attempts as an argument.  The
exception caught is provided in C<$_>, just as with C<catch>.  It should
return a true value if a retry should be attempted.

Multiple C<retry_if> blocks may be provided.  Only one needs to evaluate
to true to enable a retry.

Using a C<retry_if> block based on the retry count is an alternate way to allow
B<fewer> (but not greater) tries than the default C<delay> function, but with
the default exponential backoff behavior.  These are effectively equivalent:

    retry     { ... }
    retry_if  { shift() < 3 };

    retry     { ... }
    delay_exp { 3, 1e5 };

=func on_retry

    retry    { ... }
    on_retry { $state->reset() }
    catch    { ... };

The C<on_retry> block runs before each C<retry> block after the first attempt.
The block is passed the cumulative number of attempts as an argument.  The
return value is ignored.

Only one C<on_retry> block is allowed.

=func delay

    retry { ... }
    delay {
        return if $_[0] >= 3; # only three tries
        sleep 1;              # constant delay between tries
    }
    catch { ... };

The C<delay> block is executed when the C<retry> block throws an exception
to determine if a retry should be attempted and to manage the delay between
attempts.

The block is passed the cumulative number of attempts as an argument.  If the
C<delay> block returns an undefined value, no further retries will be made and
the most recent exception will be rethrown.

Only one C<delay> block is allowed.

=func delay_exp

    retry     { ... }
    delay_exp { 3, 10000 } # 3 tries, 10000 µsec
    catch     { ... };

This function is an exponential-backoff delay-function generator.  The delay
between attempts is randomly selected between 0 and an upper bound. The upper
bound doubles after each failure.

It requires a code block as an argument.  The block will be evaluated in list
context and must return two elements.  The first element is the number of tries
allowed.  The second element is the starting upper bound in B<microseconds>.

Given number of tries C<N> and upper bound C<U>, the expected cumulative
delay time if all attempts fail is C<0.5 * U * ( 2^(N-1) - 1 )>.
